<p><b>Review of State Websites</b></p>
<p>1. Maryland, their website was very clean. It does not contain alot of pictures, but all of the information you might be looking for on their website is easy to find. For the ease of navigating it I have ranked it first.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://www.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx">maryland.gov</a></p>
<p>2. Arkansas, thier website is very visually pleasing with many cool pictures. simularly to Maryland's website everything you might be looking for on their website seems fairly easy to find. Although I find their homepage to have alot on it, which makes it kind of confusing.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://portal.arkansas.gov/">arkansas.gov</a></p>
<p>3. Maine, I would say their website is very comparable to Arkansas. The homepage contains lots of pictures and there drop down bar is easy to find and well organized. A critisism I have is that if you split screen there website the text and pictures overlap making it hard to read.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html">maine.gov</a></p>
<p>4. Alaska, their website looks somewhat out dated visually. What I do like about their website is that all the important information on their website is easy to find. But other than that it isn't that visually pleasing and is basic.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://alaska.gov/">alaska.gov</a></p>
<p>5. Kansas, I find this to be the worst of the websites we looked at. There homepage only contains a search bar and one large picture. It looks cool, but I imagine it would be difficult to find any useful information on their website.</p>
