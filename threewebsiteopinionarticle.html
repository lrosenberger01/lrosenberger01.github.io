  <p>The First Website I Chose was apple.com</p>
  <p>Here is the link for the website <a href="http://apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a></p>
  <p>Apple has a clean and well organized website. The website contains many high quality pictures, along with basic fonts and cation placement that makes things easy to understand. The apple website is also well organized, they put their newest and most popular items on their homepage, which is nice as you get to see what they are up to as soon as you get on the website. Not only does the home page of apple's website nice, but so are all of its sub pages. Apple uses many links within in its website that lead you to more specific pages within the website to look for what you might be looking for. After looking at the code of this website I could see that they are using HTML5 elements. When I looked at the code I noticed they used many div and nav elements. I found it interesting that apple didn't use many colors in their website. Most of the colors they used came from the images they had, which too for the most part were simplistic as well. I feel this works well for apple as it gives it the clean and efficient vibe that apple wants. One of the things I like about apple's website is that it is broken into sections well, and when your scrolling the parts of the website move with it to make it easy to move from one part on the page to the next.</p>
  <p>The next website I chose was the FBI's website</p>
  <p>Here is the link for the website <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/" target="_blank">FBI</a></p>
  <p>The FBI's website is also a good website. The website contains lots of information ranging from their most wanted list to how to get a job in the FBI. Parts of the FBI's website act as a database where you can look at various cases along with other things FBI related, I think that the vast amount of information that their website contains adds to what makes it a good website. Along with this the website is also visually appealing. Although the parts of the website like the homepage contain alot of information, the information is well spread out and easy to understand. When looking at the code I can recognize many HTML elements, although parts of the code look cluttered. Like apple the FBI used many div elements in their code. The color and font that the website utalizes fits well with the FBI, they used lots of bolded lettering and mostly darker blue and white colors, which resembles the FBI jackets you often see FBI agents wearing. Parts of the website that are further from the homepage can appear fairly simple, but I think that may be beneficial as when you are actually using those parts of the website you are most likely looking for specific information and the simplicity of those parts of the website may make it easier to find what you are looking for. Much of the website appears boxy and bolded but I feel these elements add a fear/importance factor to what it is showing which goes with what the FBI is showing on their website. Overall I feel the FBI has a quality website, because the style it uses fits well with the information the website contains.</p>
  <p>The last website I looked at was EasyBib</P>
  <p>Here is the link for the website <a href="https://www.easybib.com/" target="_blank">EasyBib</a></p>
  <p>First off I would like to say I am not a fan of easybibs website. I love the function of easybib as it can write a bibliography for me and save me lots of time, when I use the website I find it confusing to figure out and the ad placement is super annoying. When you first pull up EasyBibs website four different ads will pop up which take up over half of the screen. Not only are the adds annoying to see and get in the way, but some of them will also play adds which when you don't have a good internet connection makes the website run slowly and take longer to load. After looking at EasyBibs code I recognized many HTML elements. For the most part the code for the website is well organized and like the other website I looked at used lots of div elements. One thing I noticed when looking at the code was that it was full of tons of links, this adds to the clunkyness of the website. For example to cite something using easybib you must click through at least 5 links taking you to different pages within the website, and each of these pages contains adds which makes them take longer to load. The website also seems very cluttered making it harder to navigate and find what you are looking for. The colors EasyBib uses are orange and black with a white back ground. They consistantly use the same colors which I think is a good thing. But the mess of adds which have varying colors and typically alot of colors with the bright orange that easybib utalizes sometimes makes the page look like color vomit. One of the little things that bothers me about this website is that on the same page in the website different sections will you different font sizes and styles. As you can probably tell I think EasyBib has a bad website.
